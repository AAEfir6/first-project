## Task1
https://github.com/AAEfir6/first-project/blob/main/Addition%20Calculation.py<br>
a. Methodology<br>
The objective of this task is to find the flight route with the minimum achievable cost which can let the plane fly to the final destination. There is a map, the python algorithm for pathfinding, and the parameters of the aircraft to the group to calculate and obtain the objective.<br><br>
To finish task 1, the group should modified the code to match the map was given to each group. Then test the aeroplane with different parameters in the source code to find the minimum achievable cost from those 4 aeroplanes were given.

## Task21
a. Methodology

Linear programming—We treat C(T)=x and C(F)=y.Then We got four inequalities and drew them all in the same x-y coordinate(see the black lines),after that we could find there is a common area which is surrounded by the four lines(see the red area).On the other hand because C=x*delta_F+y*delta_T+C_c. Delta_F=delta_T=5 and C_c=a constant.Therefore C=5(x+y)+C_c.We let C(min)=Z.Then simplify it we got y>=0.2(Z-C_c)-x.It means a clust of parallel lines and we drew some of them in the former coordinate(see the blue lines).The minimum C where it is must be at the border of the red area and we found that when x=20 and y=20 comes the minimum C.

c. Discussion

This method（Linear Programming）only can be applied in Linear equation in 2 unknowns.So it is not a universal method to solve many problems.However,it is a easy way to solve Task 2-1 with just a pen and a piece of paper.We got to know from the website that there is a more convenient way to deal with the problem by using computer coding.Maybe we will try it next time.
